But more importantly, these notebooks contain implementations of various useful Machine Learning Algorithms.

1. Decision Trees and Random Forests
2. Linear Regression with Ridge and Lasso
3a. Making a neural network architecture from scratch, i.e. Coding backprop by hand too!
3b. Image classification using TF (I prefer Pytorch though)
4. Support Vector Machines
