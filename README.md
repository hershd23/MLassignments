Assignments done as a part of ML, CS-503 course

But more importantly, these notebooks contain implementations of various useful Machine Learning Algorithms.

1. Decision Trees and Random Forests
2. Linear Regression with Ridge and Lasso
3. Making a neural network architecture from scratch, i.e. Coding backprop by hand too!
4. Image classification using TF (I prefer Pytorch though)
5. Support Vector Machines
